## Speer Technologies AirCall App Assessment

An application that serves to replicate basic archiving functions of a typical smart phone call log. Additional features include retrieving a list of calls and parsing the information to be properly represented.

The app has two different views, one for the activity log and one for the archived calls. You can swipe each call to the left to archive them individually or to return them to the activity log.
